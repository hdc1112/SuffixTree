# SuffixTree
A suffix tree implementation of Ukkonen algorithm

Tested for the following cases:

*    "banana"
*    "adeacdade"
*    "abcabxabcd"
*    "abcdefabxybcdmnabcdex"
*    "abcadak"
*    "abcabxabcd"
*    "mississippi"
*    "ooooooooo"
*    "aa"
*    "dodo"
*    "dedododeodo"

The implementation is applied to solve a hard leetcode problem (longest common substring) and get accepted by its online judge system: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subpath/discuss/1357875/Suffix-Tree-greater-DFS-greater-Suffix-Array-greater-Longest-Common-Prefix-greater-Monotonic-Queue-greater-Sliding-window.
